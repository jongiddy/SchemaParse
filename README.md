SchemaParse
===========

This is a stand-alone tool created during the [4D4Life project](http://www.4d4life.eu/), to create database and XSD schemas from an entity-relationship description.

It uses Scala's parsing library to read an E-R description, and create XSD, SQLite, MySQL and DOT format files.

DOT format files can be converted to PNG diagrams using GraphViz.
